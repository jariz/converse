# Converse
Converse is the AI behind the conversation window on my portfolio site, https://jari.io/.  
It's a weird experiment that will be expanded upon later.  
Simply because I'd be interested into how it works myself if I saw something like Converse on a website, I decided to put the source on GH.

##How to start

Converse can work through the command line interface or it set up a websocket server for you.  
You can choose which by adding `--interface=cli|server` to the arguments when starting.  
The rest of it is fairly straight forward, install it's dependencies with `npm install` and run it with `node .` when currently in the repo directory.  
I do accept contributions, if you can think of more cool stuff to add!
